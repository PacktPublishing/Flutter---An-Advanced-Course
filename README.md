# Flutter - An-Advanced-Course
This is the code repository for Software Automation Using Puppet For Beginners [Video](https://www.packtpub.com/in/application-development/flutter-advanced-course-video). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish. 

## About the Video Course
This is an advanced course and is not intended for beginners. In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to work with graphics, animate widgets, use maps, perform phone integration such as permissions and the camera, and work with firebase. This course picks up right where my previous courses have left off.
